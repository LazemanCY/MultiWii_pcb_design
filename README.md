# MultiWii PCB design
    These are my MultiWii hardware design since 2015.
    As a hobby, from 2015 I started to make some MWC flight controller boards for sell in Taobao.
    Then it's stopped in 2017. I'm willing to share my PCB desine to anyone who has interest in MWC.
    There're 3 types of boards: LazeShield, LazeMWC and LazeMEGA:
TBD
