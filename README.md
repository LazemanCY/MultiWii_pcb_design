# MultiWii PCB design
These are my MultiWii hardware design since 2015.<br />
As a hobby, from 2015 I started to make some MWC flight controller boards for sell in Taobao.<br />
Then it's stopped in 2017. I'm willing to share my PCB desine to anyone who has interest in MWC.<br />
There're 3 types of boards: LazeShield, LazeMWC and LazeMEGA.<br />
LazeShield is a PCB base board where you could mount Arduino-Nano and GY sensor(GY-87/86), it works as the CRIUS_SE board do.<br />
LazeMWC is a small version whose GY module is installed in its bottom side.<br />
LazeMEGA is a clone of CRIUS_AIO_PRO with GY module slot, you're free to choose GY-87 or 86 as you like. It's capable of MPNG.<br />
